# Industrial-Copper-Modelling

## Problem Statement
The copper industry deals with sales and pricing data that often suffer from issues like skewness, outliers, and missing values. Manual predictions are time-consuming and may not yield optimal pricing decisions. Additionally, capturing leads effectively is challenging. This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict sales prices and classify leads. The models will address challenges such as skewed and noisy data, missing values, and lead classification.

## Structure
1. Problem Statement Definition
Define objectives, including predicting sales prices and classifying leads.

2. Data Understanding
Understand dataset variables, distributions, and significance.

3. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values, outliers, and transform skewed data.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize outliers, skewness, and relationships between variables.

5. Feature Engineering
Create new features and drop correlated columns.

6. Model Building and Evaluation
Split data, train, evaluate models, and optimize hyperparameters.

7. Model GUI Development
Create an interactive web application using Streamlit for model predictions.


## Classification Model
For lead classification, we'll employ various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Neighbors, Extra Trees, and XGBoost classifiers.
These models will predict whether a lead is likely to convert into a customer (Won) or not (Lost) based on input features such as customer information, item details, and delivery dates, etc...,

## Regression Model
To predict sales prices, we'll utilize regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression. These models will estimate the selling price of copper products based on features like quantity, thickness, width, and customer information.
